I specialise in building bespoke web-based solutions. One of the tools I use is the [Laravel framework](https://laravel.com)</a>.
This helps me build solutions that are robust and scalable with the best practices of PHP development.</p>

Using the Laravel framework helps compatibility when working with larger teams and allows developers to be
brought up to speed quickly through the use of good documentation and the well-defined opinionated workflow.</p>

I have worked with the framework *since version 4* and have over **six** years of experience.
In which time I have helped build customer relationship management systems, large content management systems, and
integrated with various APIs.
