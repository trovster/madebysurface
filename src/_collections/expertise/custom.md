Having started off as the sole developer in a small design agency, I needed to provide a complete solution
across the **full-stack** of web technologies. There are two main areas of web development;
*server-side* and *client-side*.

### Server-side

The heavy lifting of a website or web application is done in the background. A programming language such
as PHP or Node usually talks to a database and sends the code to the browser.

For over a decade I have primarily worked with PHP and MySQL – both technologies that power WordPress –
and can build solutions for complex websites with these tools.

### Client-side

What you see in your browser is powered by three web technologies; HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Using a
combination of these three, I am able to transform your designs in to beautiful, interactive and accessibile
web experiences.
