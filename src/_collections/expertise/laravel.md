I specialise in building bespoke web-based solutions. One of the tools I use is the [Laravel framework](https://laravel.com)</a>.
This helps me build solutions that are robust and scalable with the best practices of PHP development.

Using the Laravel framework helps compatibility when working with larger teams and allows developers to be
brought up to speed quickly through the use of good documentation and the well-defined opinionated workflow.

I have worked with the framework *since version 4* and have over **six** years of experience.
In which time I have helped build customer relationship management systems, large content management systems, and
integrated with various APIs.
